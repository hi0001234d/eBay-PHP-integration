This is a complete make over of project forked from "https://github.com/iloveitaly/ebay-php", 
at some point in time i had thought of contributing to the same project but since it is a complete 
make over of project and it is no longer uses eBay's API framework, and talk directly with ebay API 
server through clean XML calls instead of using heavy eBay API framework to format that particular 
XMLs to do API calls.

Project is mainly focus on FixedPriceListing for eBay store creation, thuogh it can be easily tuned 
to automate process of any kind of eBay Listings. One added feature is use of eBay image servers 
to host product images since upto 12 images are allowed if images are hosted on eBay image servers, 
while eBay will charge extra bucks if more then 3 or 4 imges are used from self hosted servers. 

You can browse to eBay store: http://stores.ebay.com/perrianjewels which was created using this wrapper
